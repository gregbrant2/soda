Soda is a Self-hOsted Database As a service.

## A what?!?
A self-hosted database as a service.

But, isn't that a pointless contradiction? Why would you want to self-host a database as a service?

Well, maybe you want to allow your team to provision databases in a controlled way, or maybe you want to play around in the lab like I do with terraform and the like.

## So what's the plan?
The plan is to implement a simple to deploy, simple to use web app, with an API that can be used from a terraform provider and the like.
